Chapter 1 – Contact
As dawn broke, a shimmering vessel hovered over the horizon—silent, smooth, and pulsing with blue light. It wasn't a ship but something... otherworldly. Marina, curious yet cautious but not fastidious, called out to her friends.

They gathered, wide-eyed, as the craft descended gently into the bay, stirring no waves, only whispers. A door hissed open. A tall, bioluminescent being stepped forward, cloaked in robes that shifted color with the breeze. Its eyes glowed faintly. “Explorers of Earth,” it spoke through a device on its chest, “will you accompany me?”

Marina exchanged looks with the group. Their fear was real—but so was their wonder. Hearts pounding, they approached. The alien extended an elongated hand.

“I come in search of allies. A cosmic rift threatens this realm. Will you rise?”

With a breath held and hearts alight, they stepped aboard.
