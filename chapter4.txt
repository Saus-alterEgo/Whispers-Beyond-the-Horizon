Chapter 4 – Guardians of the Rift
The glade pulsed with light. As the group stepped closer, the air thickened, vibrating like a living thing. Marina reached toward the relic, but before her fingers touched it, the ground split open.

From the rift emerged figures—humanoid but translucent, shifting like mist. Their eyes glowed the same violet as the relic. The alien guide stepped forward, raising a hand in peace.

“They are the Rift Guardians,” he explained. “They protect the balance between worlds.”

Lena’s breath caught. “Are they… spirits?”

“Energy forms—ancient ones,” the alien replied. “They judge the worth of those who seek the relic.”

A Guardian floated closer, its voice echoing in their minds. "To pass, you must show unity. Fear divides. Prove you are more than fear."

Suddenly, illusions filled the glade—nightmares made real. Each friend saw their darkest thoughts, their deepest doubts. Only by calling to one another, grounding themselves in trust and shared purpose, did the illusions fade.

The Guardians slowly bowed, the relic’s glow intensifying. The path forward was now open—but what lay beyond would test more than their courage.
